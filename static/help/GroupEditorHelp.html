# The groups are used to group catagories together. For example you have to pay out to several utility companies every month and a group named "Utility" can be prefixed to a catagory entry for each utility. So phone, cellular, water and electricity expenses can be prefixed with "Utility" and all utilities will be grouped together in reports. By creating groups records you can standardize the group names and only have to enter them one time.
