# Welcome to Expenses, a simple program for tracking all of your living or business expenses without the complications of a commercial finance management program.
----

There are three parts to Expenses:

- **Expense Editor - This is the main form with which you enter your information.**
- **Catagory Editor - This is where you define the various catagories to assign to your
entrys.**
- **Groups Editor - This is where you can define groups that will organize expense catagories.**


## The Work Flow

1. **Define your groups. I have left my groups in the database and they may suffice.**
2. **Define your catagories. Again I have left my catagories in the databse.**
3. **Enter your expenditures as needed.** 

## To Do
**The final element of the program is reporting. It will be developed and distributed ASAP.**
